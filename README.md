Module 4 — Image Stitching and SIFT Feature Extraction with RANSAC
1. Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation for Module 4 of CSc 8830: Computer Vision. The objective of this assignment is to implement a full image stitching pipeline using multiple camera images and to develop a from-scratch implementation of the SIFT feature extraction algorithm with RANSAC optimization. The system also includes a web-based application that visualizes both the stitched panorama and feature matching results. All implementations are developed in Python using OpenCV and NumPy, with Flask used for web-based visualization and interaction.

2. Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple images captured using a personal camera device. At least four images in horizontal (landscape) orientation or eight images in vertical (portrait) orientation are used to generate the panorama. These images are stored in the dataset/ directory. In addition, a separate set of images is used for evaluating SIFT feature detection and matching. The dataset can be replaced with custom images as long as the directory structure is preserved.

3. Methodology

The image stitching pipeline begins by detecting feature points from overlapping images using a custom from-scratch implementation of the SIFT feature extraction procedure. The detected features are matched across image pairs using descriptor similarity. A RANSAC-based homography estimation is then performed to remove outliers and compute the geometric transformation between images. The aligned images are finally warped and blended together to form a seamless panoramic image.

For evaluation purposes, the results from the custom SIFT and RANSAC implementation are directly compared with the results obtained using the open-source SIFT implementation available in OpenCV. This comparison is used to analyze the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the custom implementation.

Additionally, the stitched panorama generated using the desktop pipeline is visually compared with the panorama image generated by a mobile phone camera using its built-in panorama feature.

4. Requirements and Setup

This project requires Python version 3.7 or higher. The use of a virtual environment is recommended to ensure proper dependency management.

To set up the environment, a virtual environment must be created and activated, followed by installation of the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file.

5. Running the Application

After installing the required packages, the system can be executed either through standalone Python scripts or through the Flask web interface. The Flask web application is started by running the app.py file. Once the server is running, the application can be accessed through a browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. The web interface allows users to upload images, perform feature extraction, visualize feature matches, apply RANSAC optimization, and generate the final stitched panorama.

6. Assignment Tasks Covered

This implementation fully satisfies all requirements of Assignment 4. The project includes a complete implementation of image stitching using multiple camera images captured by the user. A panorama is generated and compared with the stitched image produced by a mobile phone camera. A full SIFT feature extraction algorithm is implemented from scratch, including scale-space construction, keypoint detection, descriptor generation, and matching. RANSAC optimization is applied to refine the homography estimation and remove false matches. The results are also compared with the open-source SIFT implementation from OpenCV. Both the stitching and SIFT-RANSAC implementations are fully integrated into the web-based application as required.

7. Output and Results

All output images generated during execution are stored inside the static/output/ directory. These outputs include feature detection visualizations, feature matching results before and after RANSAC optimization, the final stitched panoramic image, and comparison images between the custom stitching result and the mobile camera panorama.
